The total kilometres limit for your booking is determined by multiplying the duration of your booking with the hourly "Kilometres limit" of the pricing plan that you select. If you clock more kilometres than the total kilometres limit of your booking, the additional kms attract "extra kms charges", which vary by the car model and the city.
